Autofill Automatically fills fuel (like coal) and ammo from your main inventory to entities when you create them. Including Trains, Planes, and Automobiles. Oh and Turrets, boilers, burner inserters, burner assemblers, and overpowered nuclear weapon launchers just to name a few more!

##Now with HOTKEY support!
All these keys are configurable in your Factorio - Controls - Mods menu.
Hover over an entity in the field and CTRL-F to fill it based on your ruleset!
Toggle filling limits on or off with CTRL-SHIFT-F for those times when you want to Fill something without limits.
Toggle dividing fuel/ammo amongst groups of items with CTRL-ALT-F

Current Mods with a set enabled by default:

* Additional Turrets
* Dytech mods
* Yuoki Industries - All Turrets, Boilers, Ammos
* Bob's Mods - All Turrets, Tanks including Artillery ammo, Ammos
* Uranium Power - Ammo's and shells
* Shuttle Train
* Advanced Tanks
* Combat Robots
* General Improvments
* Farl
* And many others.

####More Information

* Fuel items are automatically added and sorted from low to high anytime a mod is added, changed, or removed.
* car, diesel-locomotive and tank are loaded with fuel with highest fuel value. (+ tank includes ammos too)
* Burners group: Burner mining drills, Stone furnaces, Steel furnaces, Burner inserters and Boilers work same as vehicles, but all fuel is divided to all "burners" that are in quickbar and hand.
* Turrets group: Gun turrets are loaded with ammos (First in array first in use). Ammo is divided to all turrets in quickbar and hand.

If a mod you like doesn't work out of the box let me know and I will see about adding it, or walk your through how to add it to your personal set using the command line interface.

####Examples for making your own set:  

Create  personal setting for car.
`remote.call("af", "insertset", "", "car", {{"coal","raw-wood"}, "basic-bullet-magazine"}) `
Insert nothing to car. (ignores default setting)
`remote.call("af", "insertset", "", "car", 0) `
reset to default setting
`remote.call("af", "insertset", "", "car", nil)`

------

###TODO

* Super Awesome GUI for making sets a lot easier
* Better Error Checking
* Fuel blacklists so we are not burning our wooden power poles
